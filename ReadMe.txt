I started working on this project while on vacation in Florida.  I wanted to take a day to relax and just sit around, since school was starting back in a few days.  I've always kinda wanted to make a text based RPG and since the Internet in the timeshare where we were staying is almost unusable I figured I'd give it a shot.
