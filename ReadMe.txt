June 1 2020 Update: Started a total overhaul of everything planning to make seperste classes to perform combat and city navigation.


I started working on this project while on vacation in Florida.  I wanted to take a day to relax and just sit around, since school was starting back in a few days.  I've always kinda wanted to make a text based RPG and since the Internet where we were staying was almost unusable I figured I'd give it a shot.

Complete/Semi-Complete:
	Combat System (moved into a seperate class)
		-mostly outlined here(slightly modified to work with classes):

		-stats and such
		-randomly spawn
